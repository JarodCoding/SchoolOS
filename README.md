SchoolOS
========

SchoolOS is an OpenSource Operating System completly desingend for School use. SchoolOS hat multiple Parts. The idea behind SchoolOS is rather than having an Operating System, which is able to do everthing, and forbidd things for most user you have an operating System with only fuctions everyone is allowed to use (like the windowmanager) and download everything special a user is able to do as soon as he logs in. One final thing to note is that you are not having any kind of filemanager installed files are automaticly Managed by SchoolOS. This also applys for the mobile versions. SchoolOS just complety removes the camera app. Sounds awful doesn't it? But the reasons why students are not allowed to toy with their mobile in breaks is because they can make photos of person without their willing and the whole socialnetwork things start. But if the camera app is removed you can't take photos anymore. The teacher is able to allow you to use the camera app (which install is again) and as soon as you leave school the camera app is reinstalled. But in school you can now think of allowing mobiles again. (sounds not that awful?!)
